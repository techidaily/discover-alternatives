Intelligent Document Processing in Financial Services USE CASES 

Expedite onboarding, KYC, trade finance, and more with ready-to-use AI document processing skills that are pre-trained for the highest accuracy Delivering artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions is not new for ABBYY. We have 30 years of experience processing tens of billions of pages for customers globally, addressing the real-world challenges of our customers with technology. Our AI and machine learning technologies are highly optimized—for documents, for text, for language, for extraction, for precision, and for consistency. In 2019, ABBYY introduced the industry’s first low-code / no-code intelligent document processing platform to make this technology available in a cloud-based, point-and-click approach to empower citizen developers to easily incorporate IDP into their highly manual or repetitive document-centric processes. ABBYY Vantage provides pre-trained document processing skills in an online marketplace that are ready to use within minutes. Using ABBYY pre-trained document skills, customers are able to start production tomorrow and achieve the highest level out-of-the-box accuracy without the need for OCR and machine learning expertise. Structured Data Unstructured Documents IDP The data inside financial documents represent a wealth of information…but you can only capitalize on that data when it is visible, accessible, and able to inform action. Legacy approaches to document processing involve only basic optical character recognition (OCR) , data extraction, validation, and rules-based processing. Intelligent document processing holds much greater potential to improve cost and productivity efficiencies by employing modern, AI-based document processing “skills” to make the revenue- generating information that’s trapped within business documents immediately accessible and actionable.
