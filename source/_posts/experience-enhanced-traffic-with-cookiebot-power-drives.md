#### The combination of ABBYY Timeline with Alteryx environment delivers: 

##### Business Process Assessment 

The Timeline platform allows organizations to quickly mine, reconstruct, visualize and analyze current state business processes based on data from one or more systems to help identify and understand which business processes will benefit from analytic process automation.

##### Business Process Analytics 

Timeline’s process analytics, query, and filtering capabilities can provide inline enhancement of your analytic processes to provide additional process-aware data transformation and analytics. Simply drop the Timeline component into the Alteryx Designer and link it into the process.

##### Business Process Monitoring 

Timeline’s process monitoring provides Alteryx users with a way to monitor current business processes, even those where process steps are performed across multiple back-end systems. Users can quickly specify business conditions that require an Alteryx analytic process to be initiated.

## Integration benefits

"Process aware" the Alteryx Analytics Platform™

End-to-end advanced process discovery and analytics.

Extend Alteryx APA to identify automation opportunities.

Analyze data-driven process behaviors within Alteryx APA and initiate downstream actions, applications, or automation. Visualize the flow of work through the process stages and see the delays and bottlenecks.

Based on the results of advanced process analytics, automate appropriate actions such as alerts to human agent for escalation, or digital worker to remediate within the Alteryx APA Platform™.

Monitor processes in real time and predict future outcomes.

Invoke next process action and predict issues before they happen.

Monitor the performance of Alteryx APA data-driven processes, process deviations, and predict how processes will behave. Identify inefficient variations and set rules for the process.

Automatically generate a foundation for data-driven decisions with quantifiable process metrics, including cost, duration, and volume.

#### Usage scenarios

Combining analytics and data science automation with Process Intelligence to accelerate digital transformation.

##### Supply chain process automation 

ABBYY Timeline may analyze and monitor end-to-end supply chain processes and identify opportunities for optimization, such as the flow of documentation processes associated with the transport of goods (Delivery Orders, Doc Receipt, Bill of Lading, Packing List, and Shipping Guarantee). Process bottlenecks are determined that may result in demurrage charges when shipment of goods sit on docks. The results of the Timeline analysis may then provide additional process-aware data to the Alteryx APA Platform™ to further analyze demurrage charge exposure by country, port, and product that impacts delivery dates and service level commitments.

##### Financial services & Banking 

ABBYY Timeline may analyze and monitor financial processes such as suspicious financial transactions that exceed regulatory reporting thresholds (e.g. approvals, reviews, compliance with prescribed protocols where other deviations may exist). The results associated with processes that exhibit a behavior of concern may be passed to an Alteryx analytic process for further analysis and remedial action.

##### Healthcare 

Improve the patient experience, reduce waste, increase efficiency, and optimize processes by visualizing patient experience from start to finish. Investigate the reasons why some processes take longer than others and add alerting so that all protocols and best practices are being followed.
