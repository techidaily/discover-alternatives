The upgraded [MacX DVD Ripper Pro v4.9.5](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) not only is equipped with full compatibility with the latest iPhone 7, Galaxy S7 and the newly released macOS Sierra 10.12, but, more importantly, receives an overall facelift that will deliver strikingly beautiful, simpler, and more engaging user interface, marking a significant enhancement in DVD rip performance on all Mac computers and laptops.
