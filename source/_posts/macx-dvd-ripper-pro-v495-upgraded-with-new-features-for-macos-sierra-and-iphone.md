This update, featuring a stunning new user interface and increased support for Apple's macOS Sierra, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7, focuses on the enhanced ability that will simplify DVD ripping and increase efficiency on any generation of Mac OS X._ 

MacXDVD, an industry-leading software developer, announced today a major upgrade to its flagship DVD ripper. The upgraded [MacX DVD Ripper Pro v4.9.5](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) not only is equipped with full compatibility with the latest iPhone 7, Galaxy S7 and the newly released macOS Sierra 10.12, but, more importantly, receives an overall facelift that will deliver strikingly beautiful, simpler, and more engaging user interface, marking a significant enhancement in DVD rip performance on all Mac computers and laptops. 

MacX DVD Ripper Pro is an extremely popular [Mac DVD ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that is able to rip protected/homemade DVDs to any format fast and efficiently. It has long enjoyed a good reputation for its comprehensive rich DVD ripping features and wide availability.
