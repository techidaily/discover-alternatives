This update, featuring a stunning new user interface and increased support for Apple's macOS Sierra, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7, focuses on the enhanced ability that will simplify DVD ripping and increase efficiency on any generation of Mac OS X._ 

MacXDVD, an industry-leading software developer, announced today a major upgrade to its flagship DVD ripper. The upgraded [MacX DVD Ripper Pro v4.9.5](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) not only is equipped with full compatibility with the latest iPhone 7, Galaxy S7 and the newly released macOS Sierra 10.12, but, more importantly, receives an overall facelift that will deliver strikingly beautiful, simpler, and more engaging user interface, marking a significant enhancement in DVD rip performance on all Mac computers and laptops. 

MacX DVD Ripper Pro is an extremely popular [Mac DVD ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that is able to rip protected/homemade DVDs to any format fast and efficiently. It has long enjoyed a good reputation for its comprehensive rich DVD ripping features and wide availability. To greet the latest macOS Sierra which has impressed users with its ease and simplicity, nearly everything on the user interface of the Mac DVD ripper has received an overhaul, from the overall menu layouts to the background color and navigation buttons. Users can have a faster and more enjoyable experience when they rip DVDs on Mac within the sleek new interface.

**Cleaner, simpler, modern UI and more accessible navigation:**

The visual improvements are amazing, but a UI update of this magnitude makes no sense if early adopters of the latest macOS Sierra are not covered.

Starting today, users of macOS Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite and earlier can [rip DVDs to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MOV, AVI, FLV, WMV, MP3, other digital formats, make safe copy, remove copy protections freely and flawlessly.

The user interface is not the only thing that gets an improvement with V4.9.5 update. Among the upgraded UI changes, a number of latest mobile profiles have been added.
