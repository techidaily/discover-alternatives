MacTheRipper removes CSS encryption, Macrovision protection, sets the disc's region to '0' for region-free, and is capable of removing RCE region checking. Wait a second! 95% of these exited in the past, not today!

If you leave MTR in the dust for a long time, you need to update your perception to it. The current MTR is not what it used to be. The major changes are:

* License: MacTheRipper version 2.6.6 is free while MTR 4 is paid-for software (so called Send Gift).
* System requirements: MTR 2.6.6 supports Mac OS X 10.6 Leopard or older and MTR 4 supports Mac OS X 10.8 or older.
* DVD type: commercial DVD discs are not supported by the current MTR any more.
* Update: discontinued to update MTR. MacThe Ripper is an outdated option.

So, until now, if you prefer MTR easy-to-use interface and original resulting quality, you can insist on MacTheRipper for DVD ripping on macOS (older operating system). If not, resort to the below [top MacTheRipper alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to rip both homemade and commercial DVDs to MPEG2 file, as well as DVD to digital video format for playing back on mobile, Plex, Roku, TV.
