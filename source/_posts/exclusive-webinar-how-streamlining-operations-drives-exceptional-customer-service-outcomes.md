## Why Process Holds the Key to Unlocking Great Customer Experiences

English

### Industry experts share best practices to turbocharge your CX

The need to deliver fantastic customer experiences has never been so great. Almost every organization has **fired up new projects or initiatives**, but many of those, while not doomed to failure, are likely to underwhelm many customers.

In part, organizations think too broadly or too narrowly about **what constitutes great customer experience**. In other cases it is because so often these initiatives are totally disconnected from the operational aspects of the organization that actually deliver them.

Join CMSWire with featured speakers and industry experts Rob Koplowitz, VP, Principal Analyst at Forrester, and Mark McGregor, Director, Process Intelligence at ABBYY, **share a combination of theory and practice** to stimulate your thinking. We seek to help you turbo-charge your CX initiatives and ensure you are able to delight customers every time, through every touchpoint, every day.
