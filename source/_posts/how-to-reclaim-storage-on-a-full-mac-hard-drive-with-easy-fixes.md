## Part 4: Replace your Mac hard drive with an SSD

_I have a Macbook Pro with SSD of 500GB. My DVD drive is almost full, with music and movies. So I'm thinking of removing the optical drive and replacing it with a second drive of 1TB._ \- Dj AR1

I just performed the maneuver myself, replacing my 2011-era MacBook Pro's 500GB hard drive with the 500GB Samsung 850 EVO. The Samsung SSD and a SATA-to-USB cable kit cost me just north of $200 on Amazon. And the whole procedure took less than an hour. Really, the hardest part of the whole thing was tracking down a size 6T torx-head screwdriver for the four torx screws that help hold the disk drive in place.
