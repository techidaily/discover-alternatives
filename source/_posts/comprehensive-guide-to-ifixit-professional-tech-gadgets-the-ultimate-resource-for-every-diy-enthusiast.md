 Every year, we [throw away millions of tons of electronics](https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/electronic-waste-facts) that end up hogging space in landfills and polluting our oceans. Many of these expensive devices just need a simple 30-minute fix to be perfectly functional again, yet they end up in the garbage anyway.

 Unfortunately, some of this e-waste is a result of [planned obsolescence](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/busting-through-nwstoreexe-errors-comprehensive-fix-techniques-revealed/). But you paid to own the entire device; why should it void the warranty to open it up yourself, or get it taken to a repair shop for experts to work on? I reviewed [Valve's Steam Deck](https://www.reviewgeek.com/139290/valve-steam-deck-review/) in January 2023, and while the gaming goliath worked with iFixit to [produce repair guides and sell spare parts](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam%5FDeck), opening the handheld gaming PC you purchased is still unforgivable in the eyes of the [hardware warranty](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4e41-6123-79ef-25ba#:~:text=has%20been%20modified%20or%20repaired%20by%20anyone%20except%20a%20Valve%2Ddesignated%20service%20center%20and%20the%20cause%20of%20the%20issue%20for%20which%20you%20seek%20service%20is%20the%20modification%20or%20repair%2C%20or%20damage%20caused%20by%20either%3B).

 It doesn't even have to be damaged---you could simply replace the [SSD](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-gradual-glide-out-technique-for-audio-in-adobe-premiere-pro/), and you would still be left uncovered in the event of a faulty display or trackpad down the road.

[Right to Repair laws](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-video-from-end-to-beginning/) say the products you purchase are the products you own. No more warranty red tape. They also seek to protect you from the monopolistic practices of withholding tools and parts for repair (meaning cheaper fixes, even if you take it into a shop and don't want to tinker with the device yourself).

##  What Comes in the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit

 Unfolding the kit, you're met with tools of all shapes and sizes. Of the 13 different tools, the 64-Bit Driver and 4mm bits will likely be your go-to for most projects. The anodized aluminum Driver has a magnetic end to hold the bit in place, and the bits themselves are magnetic, too. The backend features a blue rotating piece for easy twisting. The entire kit feels premium, weighty, and satisfying.

 Looking at an unrolled pack from left to right, you'll find an antistatic wriststrap, a Suction Handle, Opening Tools, Opening Picks, Reverse tweezers, a Spudger, Angled Tweezers, Blunt Tweezers, a Halberd Spudger, Metal Spudger, and a Jimmy. To the right of these individual tools are the Flex Extension and 64-Bit Driver kit, sitting atop a magnetic surface. This surface is incredibly useful for keeping track of screws and other pieces that get lost in between repair steps.

 After the screws are loose, you'll probably reach for a Spudger or Opening Pick to get your device opened up. Then, rooting around inside the gadget, you can use the various tweezers to get in tight spaces and pick out the component(s) you need. If you're working on a mobile handset, the Suction Handle is perfect for removing phone and tablet display panels without scratching them.

 Repairing my PS4 controller was a breeze, thanks to the tools at my disposal. As you'll read, the only outside help I called on was from household supplies like isopropyl alcohol.

 I've been using the same [Dualshock PS4 controller](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Midnight-4/dp/B0799976M1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228102&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fifixit-pro-tech-toolkit-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) to play games like Rocket League and DARK SOULS: REMASTERED for a few years now, and I was starting to notice some stick drift on the left side and a few stiff buttons all around. Fortunately for me, iFixit created a [written guide on fixing stick drift](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Fix+Left+Joystick+Drift+on+a+DualShock+PS4+Controller+Without+Soldering/140074) and a [video guide that showcases an overall teardown and button cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2iyFrKAq2U).

 So, I broke out my Pro Tech Toolkit, along with a few other cheap household supplies, and got to work.

 First, I studied both guides to get a good idea of what I'd see under the controller's outer shell. When I was comfortable cracking the gamepad open, I got to work.

**Tools used:** 

* Nitrile gloves (precaution, not necessary)
* 91% isopropyl alcohol
* Cotton swabs
* iFixit 64-Bit Driver, Philips #000 bit, Flathead #1 bit
* iFixit Blunt Tweezers
* iFixit Angled Tweezers
* iFixit Metal Spudger

 Now is the perfect time to don the included [antistatic wristband](https://www.ifixit.com/products/anti-static-wrist-strap?pk%5Fcampaign={US|Shopping|MiscTools}&pk%5Fsource=google&pk%5Fmedium=cpc&pk%5Fkwd=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2-2eBhClARIsAGLQ2RkdLmTEbuSBsRQOzl24KrL7ErvJf48-DuiR7zoBud8icqDNlgclzqsaAvjaEALw%5FwcB). If you don't have one, touch a metal surface to ground yourself instead, transferring any unwanted electrons that may damage the internal components of your device.

Close 

 First, I used the 64-Bit Driver in conjunction with the Philips #000 bit to remove the four screws on the controller's backside. Then, I used the Metal Spudger to get in between the front and back covers and gently pry them apart, keeping the ribbon cable between them in mind. With the ribbon cable safely detached and the two covers separated, it's time to remove the battery pack.

Close 

 I opted for the Angled Tweezers in this case, firmly gripping either side of the battery connector and pulling upwards to detach it from the circuit board. The battery then lifts right out, though there might be a small amount of adhesive keeping it secure (no extra tools are required for this, just pull straight up).

 An absent battery exposes another 6mm screw holding the bracket in place. Remove this with the 64-Bit Driver to uncover the circuit board. At the top of the board, you'll see another ribbon cable (this one is dedicated to the controller's trackpad). I used Blunt Tweezers to grab hold of and disconnect the cable. At this point, you can now lift the entire circuit board and joysticks out of the front shell.

Close 

 Now, using a dry cotton swab, I scrubbed the pads of each button to clean off any trapped dust or dirt.

 With the buttons taken care of, I moved my attention to the left joystick. The joystick that you interact with comes right off if you pull upwards, revealing the components underneath.

Close 

 At this point, you want to pop the two green chambers open to get at the white disks between them. I used the 64-Bit Driver and Flathead #1 bit to do so, wedging the bit in between the spaces of the chambers and pushing inwards until they opened.

 With the white disks exposed, I used the Blunt Tweezers to take them out. Then, using a cotton swab soaked in 91% isopropyl alcohol, I cleaned out each chamber and let them sit for about 15 minutes to dry.

![Person with blue gloves using iFixit Blunt Tweezers to pointing to white disk inside of Dualshock PS4 controller](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ifixit-pro-tech-toolkit-white-disk-reinstalled.jpg) 

_Marcus Mears III / How-To Geek_

 With the chambers cleaned out, I was onto cleaning and reassembly. With another cotton swab, I got rid of the gunk and grime you wouldn't be able to reach without taking the controller apart. Then, I placed the two white disks back into the chambers with tweezers and used my fingers to pinch them shut. I popped the left joystick back on using my hand.

 Placing the circuit board and joysticks back into the front cover, I reconnected the ribbon cable at the top of the board using the Blunt Tweezers. The battery bracket has pegs that fit into the circuit board to make sure it's aligned properly; I lined them up and replaced the screw.

 I put the battery back in place and reconnected the wires. From this step, I was almost finished. Bring the back cover back into the picture and connect the first ribbon cable to the circuit board. With everything in line, snap the two shells back together, then replace the four original screws.

 That's all there is to it! Instead of buying a whole new controller and tossing the other out, you can feel the sense of accomplishment that comes with saving money and repairing something with your own hands.

##  Should You Buy the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit?

![iFixit 64-Bit Driver on top of Pro Tech Toolkit](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ifixit-pro-tech-toolkit-64-bit-driver-on-closed-case-1.jpg) 

_Marcus Mears III / How-To Geek_

 You don't have to be a gadget guru to use an iFixit kit, [follow their guides](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide), and come out the other end with a like-new device. The [iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/iFixit-Pro-Tech-Toolkit-Electronics/dp/B01GF0KV6G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228102&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fifixit-pro-tech-toolkit-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is an excellent investment for anyone who hates spending money to replace perfectly good electronics.

 The only downside I can name has to do with sourcing parts for repair on top of the kit's price. That isn't a knock at iFixit; they even sell the [repair parts](https://www.ifixit.com/Parts) required in many cases. It's just the reality of the situation for at-home repairs.

 But, for almost every tool you'll ever need to repair your tech, the Pro Tech Toolkit offers premium quality at a very reasonable price point of $74.99.
