#### _Demonstrates how law firms of the future can accelerate productivity with digital workers, faster document accessibility and more powerful editing and redaction tools_

ABBYY® a global leader in content IQ technologies and solutions, today released solutions that increase productivity and compliance with legal regulations and discovery requests at the American Bar Association Annual Techshow taking place in Chicago February 27 – March 2, 2019\. The latest [ABBYY FineReader 14](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a universal PDF software application, powered by best-in-breed OCR, and FineReader Server 14, an automated high-volume document conversion server, will be demonstrated at booth #1007 to illustrate how legal professionals can quickly and easily digitize paper into searchable and editable documents and PDFs to prepare them for e-discovery, collaboration, and efficient access to information. 

“Law firms and legal departments at large organizations have told us they need robust PDF solutions that are not rocket science to work with; they want tools that will automate time consuming yet critical tasks associated with case preparation, e-discovery and even with high-volume document processing,” commented Slavena Hristova, Director of Product Marketing, FineReader at ABBYY. “The latest updates with FineReader Server and FineReader 14 enable legal professionals to quickly and easily do common tasks securely, such as redacting information, bates stamping, annotating, finding relevant information or identifying changes between versions of a document, with the goal of reducing non-billable hours.”

ABBYY will also present the use of AI-enabling technologies to enhance legal professionals’ work in a session titled, “How to Make the Robots Work for You,” taking place Friday, March 1 from 11:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. CT in Grand Ballroom A. Presenters Michael Simon, legal technology thought leader and principal of Seventh Samurai, an e-Discovery and information governance consulting firm, and Andrew Pery, marketing executive and Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/C) focusing on content management and business process automation will go beyond the sci-fi hype of AI and share pragmatic applications of robotic process automation within the practice of law.
