You plan to play DVD movie with your player, which, however, needs the files to be separate to begin with. That means you need to rip subtitles from DVD as a separate .srt file. Another case, you wanna use the memorable quotes of some DVD movies into your DIY videos, but you don't find the subtitles online and fail to [download subtitles](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) from online site. In such case, extracting subtitles from DVD is your ultimate solution. 

Prior to extracting subtitles from DVD movie on Windows/macOS, you'd better have some basic knowledge about what kind of subtitles can be extracted and what can't. Here we mainly talk about the most common soft subtitles, hard subtitles, forced subtitles and closed captions.

* [Part 3: How to Free Rip Subtitles from DVD on macOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

##  Part 1: All Subtitles can be Extracted from DVD?

**Soft Subtitles**: Soft subtitles are subtitles that are **not IN** the actually video. The DVD video file and subtitles are separate as individual files. You **can rip** soft subtitles from DVD as separate [.srt](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or .ssa file. 

**Hard Subtitles**: Opposite to soft subtitles, hard subtitles (aka. burned-in subtitles) are rendered   **INTO** the actual video. To put it in another words, the subtitles and video images are melt into one. To extract hard subtitles from DVD, you can use a tool with Text Detection (OCR) feature which can detect and extract on-screen text on a video. 

**Forced Subtitles**: Forced subtitles are commonly   **on** movies and only display subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or alien language. For instance, if the movie uses English for most part, interspersed with some Spanish language, then the forced subtitles only appear in English when the Spanish dialogue shows up. Hence, you're also   **able to extract** forced subtitles from DVD.

**Closed Captions**: Closed captions are essential for people with impaired hearing and are different from the common DVD subtitles. Usually, DVD subtitles are decoded by the DVD player, while Closed Captions are decoded by the TV. Generally, there is hardly no closed captions used in common DVDs. 

To sum up, when it comes to strip DVD subtitles, it mainly refers to **soft subtitles or forced subtitles**, not hard subtitles/closed captions. 

## Part 2: How to Rip Subtitles from DVD on Windows PC

From the first part, you know what kind of subtitles can be ripped from DVD disc. And now it's time to show you how to rip soft subtitles, forced subtitles or closed captions from DVD as separate .srt, .ass or .ssa file. Generally two steps to go: rip DVD to VIDEO\_TS folder and extract subtitles from VIDEO\_TS folder via subtitle extractor tool. 

### Step 1: Free Rip DVD to VIDEO\_TS Folder

If your DVD discs are commercial DVD, 90% of the time they're encrypted. Though DVD Shrink claims to have the decryption algorithms, it only copes with the basic DVD copyright protection like DVD Region Code, CSS. When it comes to the advanced yet complicated DVD encryption technology, DVD Shrink is willing to but powerless to render help (no constantly updates on decryption algorithms because of no stable incomes for its developer teams). 

If you fail to decrypt DVD in DVD Shrink, you can free download the best DVD decrypter - [MacX DVD Ripper Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \- to tackle DVD DRM.

**4.** Select "**SubPictures to Text via OCR**' under "Action" at the right side of the interface. You can also choose "Save SubPictures as BMP" (BMP - bitmap subtitles), "Save SubPictures as SUP Files"" (SUP - image-based subtitle format) or "Only Show SubPictures".

**5.** Click "Start" button to begin free extracting subtitles from DVD as SRT text subtitle format, bitmap subtitle, or SUP file.

If you wanna know more about the difference between image based subtitles and text based subtitles, bitmap subtitles and text subtitles, etc, please read the below Q&A. 

 **SubRip tips** shared by user mats.hogberg on forum.videohelp: he explains the reasons why sometimes SubRip doesn't work for you. As he said, SubRip doesn't know an A from a Z when it starts looking at the subtitles at the first time (much similar to the infant, know nothing), so it will ask you **once** for each first time it encounders a character it hasn't seen before. As long as you tell it a Z is really a Z, it wont ask you again about Z.

Indeed, SubRip also has its first learning process and man-machine interaction inside (regarded it as intellectual robot if you like). So for the first subtitle, you're suggested to pay more patience to SubRip. Soon later, it won't bother you any more once it masters most characters and decodes (OCR) to text skillfully.

###  FAQ 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../blog/new-fourteen/question-jp.jpg)   **What is the difference between text subtitles and image subtitles?** 

 Usually, the subtitles in DVD are text based subtitles, which can be extracted from DVD and saved as .srt, .ssa or .ass. and   **easily edited**. The common   **soft subtitles and forced subtitles**  are text based subtitles. As for image subtitles, there are two different types of image-based subtitles: hard subtitles (burned-in subtitles) that can't be extracted from video folder and extractable image subtitles that is only displayed on video image (**not into**) and can be extracted from video folder. Hence, for the image-based DVD subtitles, some can be stripped from DVD movies and some (into video) can't be ripped. 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../blog/new-fourteen/question-jp.jpg)   **Could you tell me what are the common used subtitle formats?** 

 For image-based subtitles, the common used subtitle formats include .sub, .idx, .sub, .svcd, .cvd, .bmp, .jpg, .png and more.

 Bitmap subtitle is a subtitle list with all text items as encoded bitmaps. All subtitle lists that the editor read from a video file or a DVD movie are bitmap subtitles. For a bitmap subtitle, the original texts are usually inaccessible, and as the result, they are all blanks in the text list display. Text subtitle is a subtitle list with all text items in their original text forms, and this is easily identified from the text list display. Quoted from womble support.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../blog/new-fourteen/question-jp.jpg)   **What is OCR?** 

 Optical character recognition (also optical character reader, OCR) can be understood as a standard or medium, with which you can use the third-party subtitle extractor to successfully rip or convert subtitles to machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo. Especially when you need to rip subtitles from DVD as .srt text subtitles, you need OCR. For more detailed info, [visit OCR Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical%5Fcharacter%5Frecognition).

It's impossible to use HandBrake to create subtitles alone with no video. The only file types that HandBrake supports as output are MKV, MP4, and WebM. There are no output options that would create a subtitle file.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../blog/new-fourteen/question-jp.jpg) **How to rip subtitles from DVD with VLC?**
