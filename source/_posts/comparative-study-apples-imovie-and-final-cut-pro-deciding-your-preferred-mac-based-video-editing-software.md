### Pros and Cons of iMoive

Pros:

User friendly and easy to use and learn. Even if you are a newbie, you can start editing videos with iMovie right away, however time would be taken if you want to get the hang of it. You are allowed to add some effects and background music, combine several photos at once, and organize your videos to experience great function of this video editing software.

Friendly interface. The organized function layout and design on its friendly interface give you great convenience when you are editing your videos.

Convenient videos sharing. You are allowed to share and publish your edited videos on videos sites like YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo directly with iMovie.

Cons:

According to most Apple's products owners, not all varieties of MP4 are supported by iMovie due to its incompatibility, in addition to many other video formats. This issue is no doubt quite annoying as MP4 today is one of the most popular and most used video formats.

The storage space is quite limited which leads to difficulty if you have large number of projects. So you will need external hard drive soon.

iMovie doesn't perform quite stably. Sometimes, [iMovie keeps crashing](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) when editing videos on Mac and iOS devices.

Like iMovie, Final Cut Pro is only available on Mac. 

### Pros and Cons of Final Cut Pro

Pros:

This video editing software contains many powerful tools such as the magnetic timeline, background processing, good organization tools—ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes, and stabilization etc.

Final Cut Pro is able to integrate with Apple's other multimedia editing software included in Final Cut Studio.

Cons:

The film must be saved in a certain type, otherwise the image will mess up.

With more professional options available, the interface and operation inevitably become much complicated than iMovie.

It's only available for the Apple's OS X operating system and no version is made for mobile platform.
